**x_train, y_train**:
In the context of the `HRM` model or any machine learning setup, `x_train` and `y_train` are analogous to: 
- `x_train`: The input features/sequence or data points used to train the model, for example the trained word embeddings.
- `y_train`: The corresponding target values/sequence or labels for the sequence/words which the model should predict.
