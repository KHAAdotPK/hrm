**batch_size**:
The number of sentences (or samples) processed together in a single forward/backward pass during training or inference. For example, if batch_size=32, the model processes 32 sentences at once.

**seq_len**:
The length of each sentence (or sequence), typically measured as the number of tokens (words, subwords, or characters) in a sentence. For instance, if a sentence has 10 words and seq_len=10, the model expects each sentence to be padded or truncated to 10 tokens.

**d_x**:
In neural networks, d_x typically refers to the input dimension, i.e., the size of the input vector (e.g., 256 for a 256-dimensional embedding for each token). The input layer doesn’t have “neurons” in the traditional sense (like hidden or output layers); it has input units equal to the dimensionality of the input (d_x). For example, in a Skip-gram model, d_x might be the size of the embedding vector for a single token.

**d_y**:
It is the dimensions of output layer, which corresponds to the number of neurons in the output layer. For example, in a Skip-gram model, d_y often equals the vocabulary size (e.g., vocab.numberOfUniqueTokens()) because the output layer predicts a probability distribution over all possible words.

**d_h**:
In the context of neural networks (especially in NLP or related discussions like our HRM), it represents the number of neutrons in the hidden layer. 

### Initialization of Weight Matrices for Skip-gram Model in NLP
In the context of the Skip-gram model in NLP, the weight matrices are initialized as follows:

```C++
Collective<double> W1; // Weight between input ;ayer and hidden layer
Collective<double> W2; // Weights between hidden layer and output layer

try 
{
    if (!arg_input.i)
    {
        W1 = Numcy::Random::randn(DIMENSIONS{SKIP_GRAM_EMBEDDNG_VECTOR_SIZE, vocab.numberOfUniqueTokens(), NULL, NULL});
        W2 = Numcy::Random::randn(DIMENSIONS{vocab.numberOfUniqueTokens(), SKIP_GRAM_EMBEDDNG_VECTOR_SIZE, NULL, NULL});
    }
    else
    {
        W1 = Collective<double>{NULL, DIMENSIONS{SKIP_GRAM_EMBEDDNG_VECTOR_SIZE, vocab.numberOfUniqueTokens(), NULL, NULL}};
        W2 = Collective<double>{NULL, DIMENSIONS{vocab.numberOfUniqueTokens(), SKIP_GRAM_EMBEDDNG_VECTOR_SIZE, NULL, NULL}};

        READ_W_BIN(W1, argv[arg_w1.i + 1], double);
        READ_W_BIN(W2, argv[arg_w2.i + 1], double);
    }
}
catch (ala_exception& e)
{
        std::cout<< "main() -> " << e.what() << std::endl;
}
```
